BOM README!

To build a V-SUB-0 you will need the standard BOM for all standard parts shared by it's bigger brother "the VORON V0"

In addition to this, to complete you're build you will need some more cutom electronics and components. ie. heater for the bed, custom build plate etc.
These are listed (with links) to where you can find them.
There may be options to consider from the custom BOM and it will depend on what you choose to fit where on the printer as space is at a premium.
