 After seeing SUB 0 on a Video at the RMRRF I knew i had to build one! THis led me down the rabit hole of creating the CAD work to make the build possible and for others to also enjoy.
 
 For this I chose to go slightly bigger with the build volume
 coming in at a whopping 42 x 42 x 42mm

 It uses MGN7H carriages and a 70mm rail.
 These can be found on Ali express. - Link in the BOM

 The power supply is a AC/DC computer power brick providing 24vdc - 6Amps through a 5.5mm jack plug (where you would normally plug in the mains) Plans are afoot to have an integrated power supply and mini mains plug!

 The RPI and BTT Pico are mounted on standoff's and nestle neatly in the back of the printer.

 The Nema 14's have been changed to 42mm versions to help with room in the electronics enclosure.

 The Mini Kirigami Bed is now printed as it is sooo small now, it should be more than stiff enough for the tiny build volume.

 > [!NOTE]
> Most of the printed parts are standard V0.2r1's - Custom parts have been added to a separate folder.

A BIG THANKYOU TO THE VORON DESIGN TEAM AND THEIR AWESOME WORK AND TO ICARUS FOR STARTING THE WHOLE THING!
