# Voron_Sub_0-70
 Honey I shrunk the V0!

![V0 2R1 + Sub 0 - Master Assembly v2](https://github.com/Driftrotor/Voron_V-SUB_0-70/assets/94327757/0494c63b-297e-492f-a44c-6f231fd8777a)

 This is my own version of the Famous Voron Sub 0 created by Icarus from the Voron Design Team.
 After seeing it on a Video at the RMRRF I knew i had to build one, but as this was a showcase build for the RMRRF stall there was no CAD anywhere for it.
 So that led me to create my own CAD and work on getting all the small details done to make it as complete a build as possible.

 For this I chose to go slightly bigger with the build volume
 coming in at a whopping 42 x 42 x 42mm

 It uses MGN7H carriages and a 70mm rail.
 These can be found on Ali express.

 The power supply is a AC/DC computer power brick providing 24vdc - 6Amps through a 5.5mm jack plug (where you would normally plug in the mains)

 The RPI and BTT Pico are mounted on standoff's and nestle neatly in the back of the printer.

 The Nema 14's have been changed to 42mm versions to help with room in the electronics enclosure.

 The Mini Kirigami Bed is now printed as it is sooo small now, it should be more than stiff enough for the tiny build volume.

 Most of the printed parts are standard V0.2r1's - I will add in the Custom print files a little later.

 A BIG THANK YOU TO THE VORON TEAM AND THEIR AWESOME WORK
